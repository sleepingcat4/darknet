### How to run this on windows?
Clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/sleepingcat4/darknet.git`  

then `cd darknet`

and then run `darknet`

At the moment, you can't do much out of the box since https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet is long dead. I have to make changes but if you want to reprogram the code and have the dataset, haha go ahead. I will reprogram this repo in the next few weeks and submit the commits.
